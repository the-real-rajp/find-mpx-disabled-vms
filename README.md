# MPX VM Settings
There are three scripts to find (1) and set MPX settings (2) on VMs in vCenters.

These scripts are based on VMware KB 76799 (https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/76799)

You will be given a username and password prompt. The scripts do not store any usernames or passwords.

# find-mpx-enabled-vms.ps1

This script runs PowerShell commands that find MPX settings on all VMs in one vCenter.

The user must have read access to vCenter.
